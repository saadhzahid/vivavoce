# Valhalla Viva #


Vallaha Viva is a digital implementation of the traditional Viva Voce Exam.

Teachers will be able to assign Viva Voce assignments with a set of questions, which the student can access like a normal Moodle assignment and record a response to the questions using their webcam and microphone. The teacher will be able to view these submissions back and provide a grade and feedback.

## Configuring OpenAI and AWS S3 ##

The plugin makes use of Generative AI with OpenAI API and cloud storage using AWS S3 Bucket.

Likewise, to set up AWS S3 Bucket, you will need to navigate to https://aws.amazon.com/ to set up your S3 Bucket and the API key required to access your AWS services. Please ensure your S3 Bucket has the appropiate read/write permissions as the plugin will not function without them.

```
